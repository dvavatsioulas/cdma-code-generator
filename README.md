# Orthogonal code generator for CDMA  
<b> Try the app online at: <a href="https://dvavatsioulas.github.io/cdma-code-generator/">dvavatsioulas.github.io/cdma-code-generator</a> </b>

Generates spreading codes for stations within a CDMA system, based on the number of stations you want the system to support (must be a power of 2).  
The result is a Walsh-Hadamard matrix, in which rows and columns are orthogonal to each other,  i.e. dot product is zero.
